# Frequently Asked Questions

## The Registry

### What is the difference between "Official MCP Registry", "MCP Registry", "MCP registry", "MCP Registry API", etc?

There are four underlying concepts:

- "Official MCP Registry" (or "MCP Registry") — The application that lives at `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`. This registry currently only catalogs MCP servers, but may be extended in the future to also catalog MCP host applications and more.
- "MCP Server Registry API" (or "MCP Registry API") — The OpenAPI specification defined in [openapi.yaml](./api/openapi.yaml). This is a reusable API specification that anyone building any sort of "MCP server registry" should consider adopting / aligning with.
- "Official MCP Registry API" — The REST API served at `https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io`, which is a superset of the MCP Registry API. Its OpenAPI specification can be downloaded from [https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/openapi.yaml](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/openapi.yaml)
- "MCP server registry" (or "MCP registry") — A third party, likely commercial, implementation of the MCP Server Registry API or derivative specification.

## Publishing

### What's the difference between closed source and private servers?

**Closed source servers** have proprietary code but are **publicly accessible**:
- ✅ **Supported**: Can be published to the registry
- ✅ Source code can be proprietary/closed source
- ✅ Installation via public package registries (npm, PyPI, Docker Hub, etc.)
- ✅ Remote servers hosted on public URLs

**Private servers** are **access-restricted** regardless of source code:
- ❌ **Not supported**: Cannot be published to the official registry
- ❌ Only accessible to specific users/organizations
- ❌ Installation requires private credentials or network access
- ❌ Remote servers on private networks or behind authentication

**Example**: A commercial MCP server distributed as a paid npm package is closed source but publicly accessible, so it's welcome in the registry. A server only available on your company's internal network is private and not supported.

### Can I publish a private server?

Private servers are those that are only accessible to a narrow set of users. For example, servers published on a private network (like `mcp.acme-corp.internal`) or on private package registries (e.g. `npx -y @acme/mcp --registry https://artifactory.acme-corp.internal/npm`).

These are generally not supported on the official MCP registry, which is designed for publicly accessible MCP servers.

If you want to publish private servers we recommend you host your own MCP subregistry, and add them there.

### Can I delete/unpublish my server?

At time of last update, this was open for discussion in [#104](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/issues/104).

### How do I update my server metadata?

Submit a new `server.json` with a unique version string. Once published, version metadata is immutable (similar to npm).

### Can I add custom metadata when publishing?

Yes, extensions under the `x-publisher` property are preserved when publishing to the registry. This allows you to include custom metadata specific to your publishing process.

## Security & Trust

### How do I know a server is from the claimed organization?

DNS verification ensures namespace ownership. For example:

- `com.microsoft/server` requires DNS verification of microsoft.com
- `io.github.name/server` is tied to a GitHub account or GitHub organization `name`

### Is there security scanning?

The MVP delegates security scanning to:
- underlying package registries; and
- subregistries

### How is spam prevented?

- Namespace authentication requirements
- Character limits and regex validation on free-form fields
- Manual takedown of spam or malicious servers

In future we might explore:
- Stricter rate limiting (e.g., 10 new servers per user per day)
- Potential AI-based spam detection
- Community reporting and admin blacklisting capabilities

## API & Integration

### Will there be webhooks?

Not in the initial MVP, but the architecture supports adding webhooks for update notifications in the future.

### Can I extend the registry API?

Yes, we support `x-com.example` style extensions in a bunch of places - see the official MCP registry API spec. This can be used to add annotations to many objects, e.g. add security scanning details, enrich package metadata, etc.

If you have a use case that can't be addressed here, raise a GitHub issue!

### Can I use the code here to run my own registry instance?

The registry implementation here is not designed for self-hosting, but you're welcome to try to use it/fork it as necessary. Note that this is not an intended use, and the registry maintainers cannot provide any support for this at this time.

## Operations & Maintenance

### What if I need to report a spam or malicious server?

1. Report it as abuse to the underlying package registry (e.g. NPM, PyPi, DockerHub, etc.); and
2. Raise a GitHub issue on the registry repo with a title beginning `Abuse report: `

### What if I need to report a security vulnerability in the registry itself?

Follow [the MCP community SECURITY.md](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/.github/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
