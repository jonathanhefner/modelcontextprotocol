The MCP Registry is the official centralized metadata repository for publicly accessible MCP servers, backed by major trusted contributors to the MCP ecosystem such as Anthropic, GitHub, PulseMCP, and Microsoft.

The MCP Registry provides:

- A single place for server creators to publish metadata about their servers
- Namespace management through DNS verification
- A REST API for MCP clients and aggregators to discover available servers
- Standardized installation and configuration information

Server metadata is stored in a standardized [`server.json` format](TODO), which contains:

- The server's unique name (e.g., `io.github.user/server-name`)
- Where to locate the server (e.g., npm package name, remote server URL)
- Execution instructions (e.g., command-line args, env vars)
- Other discovery data (e.g., description, server capabilities)

## The MCP Registry Ecosystem

The MCP Registry is part of an ecosystem that looks something like:

### Relationship with Package Registries

Package registries — such as npm, PyPI, and Docker Hub — host packages with code and binaries.

The MCP Registry hosts metadata that points to those packages.

For example, a `weather-mcp` package could be hosted on npm, and metadata in the MCP Registry could map the "weather v1.2.0" server to `npm:weather-mcp`.

The [Package Types guide](./package-types.mdx) lists the supported package types and registries. More package registries may be supported in the future based on community demand. If you are interested in building support for a package registry, please [open an issue](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry).

### Relationship with Server Developers

The MCP Registry supports both open-source and closed-source servers. Server developers can publish their server's metadata to the registry as long as the server's installation method is publicly available (e.g., an npm package or a Docker image on a public registry) _or_ the server itself is publicly accessible (e.g., a remote server that is not restricted to private networks).

The MCP Registry provides a cross-platform CLI tool (`mcp-publisher`) that can generate a metadata template and push the metadata to the Registry. See the [Quickstart guide](./quickstart.mdx) for a usage example.

### Relationship with Downstream Aggregators

The MCP Registry is intended to be consumed primarily by downstream aggregators, such as MCP server marketplaces.

The metadata hosted by the MCP Registry is deliberately unopinionated. Downstream aggregators can provide curation or additional metadata such as community ratings.

We expect that downstream aggregators will use the MCP Registry API to pull new metadata on a regular but infrequent basis (for example, once per hour).

### Relationship with Other MCP Registries

In addition to a public REST API, the MCP Registry defines an [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/blob/main/docs/reference/api/openapi.yaml) that other MCP registries can implement in order to provide a universal interface for MCP host applications.

We expect that many downstream aggregators will implement this interface. Private or isolated MCP registries can implement it as well to benefit from existing host application support.

### Relationship with MCP Host Applications

The MCP Registry is not intended to be directly consumed by host applications. Instead, host applications should consume other MCP registries, such as downstream marketplaces, via a REST API conforming to the official MCP Registry's OpenAPI spec.
